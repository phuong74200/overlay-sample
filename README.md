The Xbox Game Bar software development kit allows you to build widgets for Xbox Game Bar. An Xbox Game Bar widget is a Windows UWP XAML app that has a XAML view rendered into Xbox Game Bar's UI.

Aside from a slightly different app activation and a little "bootstrapping" when the app is activated, an Xbox Game Bar widget is no different than any other UWP XAML app. In fact your UWP XAML app can be a normal app (support foreground activation) and one or more Xbox Game Bar widgets (support Xbox Game Bar widget activation).

When your app is activated, it will know which activation type is happening so it can create the correct corresponding XAML view.

These samples will allow you to discover how to build your own Game Bar widget.
